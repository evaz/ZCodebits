First, Let's set up our HTML page. Make a DIV that tells you your LoginStatus, a Login Button, and a Logout Button. 

Next let's include The Facebook Javascript Library, which is located under the Javascript SDK Reference page.

Return to the top and just Copy and Paste fb-root DIV (required for SDK to load), and FB.INIT; if you are working on LOCALHOST, delete the channelUrl line. Otherwise, just do what the comments are telling you to do, which leads us to our APP ID.

For those that already have an APP ID, go ahead and skip to ____The rest of you, listen up. To get a Facebook APP ID, click on the "Settings Page" link right under Authentication&Authorization. 

Click on "+ Create a New App", and fill it out. If you're using localhost, don't check Web Hosting. SITE DOMAIN will be http://localhost. SITE URL will be http://localhost:9393/ Once you have that set up, copy your APP ID and paste it into your FB.init code. Boom. Facebook has been initialized.

The next library is that for JQUERY, because it makes everything look so much more beautiful-in which case you shall witness-right now.

Select our LOGINBTN, and call FB.LOGIN (which is defined in the source link) Then set a function called fbLoggedInOut as your parameter. Do the same for your LOGOUTBTN. 

Now, let's DEFINE OUR FUNCTION fbLoggedInOut. Direct yourself to FB.login under Auth Methods in the left navigation.

Do not copy and paste example! It's unnecessary and ugly, so let's do it our simpler and easier way, simply using the example as our guide. 

The first two lines are the same (23+24) -- be sure to note how everything from "function" on are part of the parameters for FB.login. In order to make things easier to understand and also more organized, i separated the function and called it fbLoggedInOut.

If you get a response object after clicking login (24), alert this and change the status text. And such the same, for clicking on LOGOUT (28), when your response does NOT have an object. 

To see the response object, by the way, you can insert console.log(response) to see your cool Facebook object (27)[right click, view element, and go to Console]

You have now built your own fb Log In button. Woohoo!
See you at the next CodeCastle!
